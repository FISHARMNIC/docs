<hr />
<h2 id="integer">Integer</h2>
<pre><code>u32: 32-bit number (int)
u16: 16-bit number (short int)
u8 : 8-bit  number (signed char)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="pointers">Pointers</h2>
<pre><code>p32: Pointer to a 32-bit number (int *)
p16: Pointer to a 16-bit number (short int *)
p8 : Pointer to a 8-bit  number (signed char *)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="floatingpoint">Floating point</h2>
<pre><code>f32: 32-bit float (float)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="special">Special</h2>
<pre><code>conststr : Same as p8 but for string literals. Allows for special functionality in printing
string   : Same as constr except for dynamically allocated strings
array    : Same as `p32:dynamic` except quicker notation. Value should be allocated dynamically
array16  : Same as above but `p16:dynamic`
array8   : Same as above but `p8:dynamic`

fn       : For function types. Can be called from without the `call` keyword

any      : Accepts any 32-bit STATIC type without warning. Can also be called from without `call`
dyna     : Similar to `any` but for dynamic types

auto     : Assumes its type on first set. Default for untyped uninitiated variables, returns, and properties
           ** `auto` cannot be used for parameters **
unknown  : Same as `auto`
</code></pre>
<h2 id="noticeonany">Notice on "any"</h2>
<p>The <code>any</code> type is actually more of a loose <code>u32</code>. So it should not be used for doing things such as adding, since if you pass two floats to the function it might give you the wrong answer (you can use <a href="/docs/Functions/Overloads.html">supportive overloads</a> for this instead). Its more meant for for a case where you aren't doing any operation on the value. Similar is true for <code>dyna</code></p>
<h2 id="typeannexes">Type annexes</h2>
<p>Types can be annexed with a colon to provide further information about the type. The currently supported annexes are as follows</p>
<pre><code>type:borrowed  : Converts a dynamic type to a static, removes the need for memory borrowing
type:array     : Converts a type to a dynamic. If the type is already dynamic, it makes the elements dynamic
type:dynamic   : Similar to type array, but doesn't convert type to pointer
type:reference : Similar to c++ pass by reference, allows for modifying original value of parameter being passed
</code></pre>
<h2 id="formats">Formats</h2>
<p>After declaring a format, the name of the format can now be used as a regular type. See <code>formats</code>.</p>
