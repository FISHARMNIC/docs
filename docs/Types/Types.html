<h2 id="integer">Integer</h2>
<pre><code>u32: 32-bit number (int)
u16: 16-bit number (short int)
u8 : 8-bit  number (signed char)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="pointers">Pointers</h2>
<pre><code>p32: Pointer to a 32-bit number (int *)
p16: Pointer to a 16-bit number (short int *)
p8 : Pointer to a 8-bit  number (signed char *)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="floatingpoint">Floating point</h2>
<pre><code>f32: 32-bit float (float)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="special">Special</h2>
<pre><code>conststr : Same as p8 but for string literals. Allows for special functionality in printing
string   : Same as constr except for dynamically allocated strings
array    : Same as `p32:dynamic` except quicker notation. Value should be allocated dynamically
array16  : Same as above but `p16:dynamic`
array8   : Same as above but `p8:dynamic`

any     : Accepts any 32-bit type without warning
smart   : !! Still in development !!
</code></pre>
<h2 id="typeannexes">Type annexes</h2>
<p>Types can be annexed with a colon to provide further information about the type. The currently supported annexes are as follows</p>
<pre><code>type:borrowed : Converts a dynamic type to a static, removes the need for memory borrowing
type:array    : Converts a type to a dynamic. If the type is already dynamic, it makes the elements dynamic
type:dynamic  : Similar to type array, but doesn't convert type to pointer
</code></pre>
<h2 id="formats">Formats</h2>
<p>After declaring a format, the name of the format can now be used as a regular type. See <code>formats</code>.</p>
