<p>Memory allocation/deallocation is done automatically by HAM. In order to do this, it uses a <a href="https://github.com/FISHARMNIC/RollCall">garbage collection system</a> (called RollCall) that I designed. Shortly explained, all data that has been allocated via RollCall can only have one owner at a time. If at any point that owner looses its reference, the data is now free to be collected.  </p>
<p>A <code>dynamic type</code> is any form of data that has been allocated via RollCall. All Dynamics are supersets of normal types and format types, meaning that you can turn any type into a dynamic. This is done by writing <code>TYPE:dynamic</code> or <code>TYPE:array</code>, such as <code>p8:dynamic</code> (also known as the <code>array8</code> type). Depending on <code>TYPE</code>, if it's already dynamic, doing <code>TPYE:array</code> will make its elements dynamic. If you want a dynamic to be static, use <code>TYPE:borrowed</code>.</p>
<p>The difference between <code>TYPE:dynamic</code> and <code>TPYE:array</code> is that the first one will convert that type to a pointer, and the second convert it to an array of that type.</p>
<p>When you do something such as create a new instance of an array or format, that data automatically turned into a dynamic type.</p>
<p>In HAM, ownership assignation is automatic. This means that setting any variable to any data that is a dynamic type will remove that old variables ownership and give it to the new one. Below is an example of this.</p>
<pre><code>// Inside of some function...
create bob &lt;- {1,2,3};    /* bob is now of type p32:dynamic (aka array) */
create jon &lt;- bob;        /* bob no longer owns the data. jon does now. */
create nina &lt;- borrow jon; /* Nina doesn't own the data, but the variable can read it */
</code></pre>
<p>This can be circumvented by using the keyword <code>borrow</code>, which is explained <a href="/docs/Keywords/Borrow.html">here</a>. Borrow simply copies the reference without transferring ownership to the new variable.</p>
