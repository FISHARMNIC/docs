<h1 id="functionoverloads">Function overloads</h1>
<hr />
<p>Currently, function overloads are only supported on functions, constructors, and operators, but NOT methods. </p>
<h2 id="supportiveoverloads">Supportive overloads</h2>
<p>If you have two functions that <em>appear</em> to do the same thing, then you can do a supportive overload. This is useful because it can remove code duplication on your end.</p>
<p>Below is an example and the proper syntax. Supportive overloads also work for constructors and operators, and will work for methods once they support overloads.</p>
<pre><code>add function supports (
    &lt;u32 a, u32 b&gt;       -&gt; u32,
    &lt;f32 a, f32 b&gt;       -&gt; f32,
    &lt;string a, string b&gt; -&gt; string,
)
{
    return(a + b);
}

entry function&lt;&gt; -&gt; u32
{
    print_(add(123,456));
    print_(add(1.23,4.56));
    print_(add("123","456"));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that in this example, the assembly isn't actually the same, however to you it appears the same.</p>
