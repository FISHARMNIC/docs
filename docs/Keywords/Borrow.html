<h1 id="keywordborrow">Keyword: <code>borrow</code></h1>
<hr />
<p>Borrow can be used during the assignation of a dynamic reference. It forces the data pointer to be copied without ownership being transfered to it.</p>
<p>The following code is an example method that would be inside a Linked-list format called <code>Linked</code>. The <code>borrow</code> on the third line is needed as <code>this</code> is a dynamic reference that is owned by <code>linkedInstance</code>. If <code>borrow</code> was not used, the ownership would be transfered to <code>reference</code>, and <code>linkedInstance</code> would no longer own the data.  </p>
<p>On the first line, <code>findLast</code> is returning a borrowed variant of <code>Linked</code>. This is an example of type annexing which can be read about <a href="/docs/Types/Types.html">here</a>. In short, reading / setting a variable to the value that it returns will not claim ownership over that data.</p>
<pre><code>.findLast method&lt;&gt; -&gt; Linked:borrowed
    {
        create reference &lt;- borrow this;
        while(reference.next != 0)
        {
            reference &lt;- reference.next;
        }
        return reference;
    }

...

create linkedInstance &lt;- Linked(123);
</code></pre>
