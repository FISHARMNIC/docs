<h1 id="keywordcall">Keyword: <code>call</code></h1>
<hr />
<p>In order to call a function, the compiler needs to acknowledge it's existence. This means that one of the following must be true:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The function is pre-defined in the compiler</li>
<li>The function has been declared and compiled</li>
<li>The function has been defined in a forward declaration<br />
<br></li>
</ul>
<p>If none of these are true however, a function can still be called via a pointer. This pointer can be a direct memory address, a variable, etc. In order to do so, before the function call, you must write <code>call</code>. You can also provide a return type (optional) by adding a type after the word <code>call</code>.</p>
<pre><code>/* 
 * Example function that expects a function as it's third parameter
 * In this case, 'iterator' is a p32. The type doesn't actually matter as long as it holds 32 bits
*/
forEach function&lt;p32 arr, u32 size, p32 iterator&gt; -&gt; u32 {
        create i &lt;- 0;
        while(i &lt;: size)
        {
            /* 
             * Call the iterator and read its return as a u32 
             * The "-&gt; u32" can be taken out, this is just to show
            */
            call iterator(arr[i]) -&gt; u32;
            i &lt;- (i + 1);
        }
        return 0;
    }
