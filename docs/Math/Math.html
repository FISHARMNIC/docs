<h1 id="math">Math</h1>
<hr />
<p>All math must be done inside of a parenthesis. This ensures proper evaluation  </p>
<p>Currently, there is only proper order of operations for integer math, but it will be added for float math very soon.</p>
<p>If there are no floating points (neither variables nor literals), then the compiler will automatically use integer math.</p>
<pre><code>/*
 * Here, the function "factorial" returns a u32
 * By using "1.0" instead of just "1", that tells the compiler to calculate with float math
 * Additionally, the second parenthesis ensures that the division will happen first
*/
create jon &lt;- (sum + (1.0 / (factorial(sum_index))));
